Hello World,

My name is Temi Mihael, but I like to be called Lazy Coder.

Today on React.Js is a typical new React programmer's first project which is the Counter app.
So here is my version of the React Counter app I created to start my induction into React.Js.
The journey begins from here.

Happy Coding.
